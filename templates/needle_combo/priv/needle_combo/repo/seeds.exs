# Script for populating the database. You can run it as:
#
#     mix run priv/needle_combo/repo/seeds.exs
#
# Inside the script, you can read and write to any repositories directly:
#
#
#     NeedleCombo.Repo.insert!(%NeedleCombo.SomeSchema{})
#
# We recommend using the bang functions (`insert!`, `update!`
# and so on) as they will fail if something goes wrong.
